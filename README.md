# BATTLECRUISER
A game where you control a large Battlecruiser in the center of the screen, fighting off hordes of enemies trying to destroy you. Protect the Terran Dominion!

## Basic Idea So Far:
- Have a stationary battlecruiser in the center of the screen
- Scourge will fly towards the battlecruiser and attempt to ram it for massive damage (New enemies are out of scope, can be included later if I can get the scourge working)
- The player can fire lasers from the battlecruiser at Scourge to destroy them (Maybe airburst munitions like missile command?)
- Set healthpoints for the Battlecruiser and Scourge
- Set sounds for the game
- Set a winning condition / score and play a new screen + winning gif when the level is complete.
- Create a main menu that navigates to the actual game when clicked, etc.

### Day 1 Progress:
- Setup README.md File.
- Beginning initial research.
- Gathered audio sounds for use in the game.
- Created title-card for the game.
- Drafted out the rough look of the game.
- Set up the GameOver function.
- Set up the Init function for the start of the game
